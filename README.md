# RoadSenseAI
Roadsense.AI refers to the process of categorizing road traffic accidents based on their severity. 
This task is typically performed by analyzing various attributes of the accident such as the number of vehicles involved, 
the extent of damage to the vehicles, the number and severity of injuries sustained by drivers and passengers, and any fatalities that may have occurred.

The goal of  RoadSenseAI classification is to help emergency services prioritize their response to accidents,
as well as to help government agencies and transportation planners identify areas where road safety improvements may be needed.
In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been used to automate the process of road traffic severity classification. These algorithms are typically trained on large datasets of historical accident data,
and can be used to predict the severity of new accidents in real time based on their attributes.
